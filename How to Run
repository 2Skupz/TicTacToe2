How to Run:
From terminal:
	javac playTicTacToe.java CPUPlayer.java move.java ticTacToe.java
	java playTicTacToe

Improvements:
	When the computer makes a move, it should sum up the score at every move
	The thought would be that the computer should choose moves that are more likely for me to make a mistake
	The best example would be the first and second moves of the game. There is a big difference between going in square (0,0) vs. (1,2). (0,0) is much more likely to win.

I think the board should be a 1-D array, rather than a 2-D array.
	That'd be a big upgrade, but one that makes sense.
	0 1 2
	3 4 5
	6 7 8
